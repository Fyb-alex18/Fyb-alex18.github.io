I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduation in 2028!

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 02

Lab 02 is where it all started with us actually getting to do hand on coding. I really enjoyed this lab because it was one of our first labs where we were coding and because it was where I met some really great people that I would continue my journey in computer science. It being our first lab we all struggled with the things that it was telling us to do but in the end we asked for help from our professors and we were able to complete the lab.

* Lab 04, Part 1

This lab was funny but it got messy for me and my partner because of some habits we needed to fix but it helped us understand our mistakes and to not do them again. Every time we finished a statement we would forget to add “ ; “ at the end of it and there were times where we would forget to remove a space at the end of the statement causing us to have errors.We learned this hard way because everytime we had to format it looked fine but formatting does not tell use that there is a space at the end of the statement, so we were really confused and we had a moment of ah ha when we remembered that our professor saying that a space can cause errors and can not be seen.

* Lab 10, Part 1

Lab 10 was one of the confusing labs I had, but me and my partner asked questions to figure out what we had to do and we looked back at the notes provided by our professor to complete the lab. A moment that I enjoyed from this lab was that my partner was confused about double vectors and I had trouble explaining it to him but then I was able to explain it to him in Minecraft terms and he actually got what I was trying to say. I found this hilarious. We both had moments where we explained things to each other and it was really helpful to me and him because being able to express our ideas allowed us to understand the assignment.
